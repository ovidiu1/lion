/**
 * A modelValue can demand a certain type (Date, Number, Iban etc.). A correct type will always be
 * translatable into a String representation (the value presented to the end user) via the
 * `formatter`. When the type is not valid (usually as a consequence of a user typing in an invalid
 * or incomplete viewValue), the current truth is captured in the `Unparseable` type.
 * For example: a viewValue can't be parsed (for instance 'foo' when the type should be Number).

 * The model(value) concept as implemented in lion-web is conceptually comparable to those found in
 * popular frameworks like Angular and Vue.

 * The Unparseable type is an addition on top of this that mainly is added for the following two
 * purposes:
 * - restoring user sessions
 * - realtime updated with all value changes
